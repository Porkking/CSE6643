# CSE6643
This is a project for CSE6643 Numerical Algebra. In this project, we combine non-negative least square problem with general least square algorithms. We based on these algorithms to build Chemical mass balance (CMB) models. After building the model, we use the data from North Carolina to test our algorithms and compare these algorithms both for accuracy and efficiency.
